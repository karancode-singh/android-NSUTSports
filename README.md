# NSUT Sports Android App

An end-toend Android Application (published on the Play Store) for tracking Winter Sports event going on in the college. It had 400+ weekly unique active users for a span of a month during which winter sports were live in college with 500+ downloads within 1 week of release which is 1/7th of the target audience.

### Working of app in brief
Data is fetched from a Firebase Database & pending (with info on date & time) & finished (with info on date & score) sports matches going on in NSUT are displayed.
The data is stored onto the Firebase Database using another auxiliary app for the admins that is developed by me & my teammate as well.

### Features
- Choose your branch & section, it gets saved & not asked again (option to change is there if required). According only those matched can be viewed that the particular class has played or will play.
- Option to view all matches for every branch of the same year.
- Beautiful & Modern UI to engage users with all content sorted & filtered.
- Real-time update in the list of the app as soon as it changes on the server.
- All data is stored & viewed offline until connected to internet or before all updated data is fetched from the server.
- Many more miscellaneous features to enhance the user experience & efficiency of the app.
